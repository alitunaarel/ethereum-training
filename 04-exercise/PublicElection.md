# Exercise 1

Create a smart contract:
* that symbolizes a vote with a start and end date.
* where only the owner of the contract can add candidates
* where any user can register to vote as long as they pay 3000 finney (hint: http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/units-and-global-variables.html#ether-units)
* where the registered users can vote on a candidate
* when triggered by the owner the winner gets all the funds, but only when the end date is passed
