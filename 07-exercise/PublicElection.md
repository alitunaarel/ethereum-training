# Exercise 2

Modify the DAPP so:
* a migration creates the vote
* the migration adds 3 candidates
* the webpage shows the candidates with their votes
* a user can vote on a candidate

For the fast ones, try to add something cool that was not asked.
You can demo this to the group when ready, or just share it on Slack later on.
